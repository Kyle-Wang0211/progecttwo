/// Dynamic weight scheduler for Gate/Soft evidence blending
///
/// DESIGN:
/// - Early stage: Gate evidence dominates (geometry foundation)
/// - Late stage: Soft evidence dominates (quality refinement)
/// - Smooth transition using smoothstep interpolation
///
/// INVARIANTS:
/// - Pure function: no side effects, deterministic
/// - gate + soft ≈ 1.0 (within epsilon)
/// - gate is non-increasing, soft is non-decreasing
/// - Cross-platform stable (no floating-point drift)

    ///   - constants: Evidence constants (defaults to EvidenceConstants)
    /// - Returns: Tuple (gate, soft) where both are in [0, 1] and sum ≈ 1.0
