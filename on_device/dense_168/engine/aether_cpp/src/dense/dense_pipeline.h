// dense_pipeline.h — the on-device dense point cloud job (Stage 1 + Stage 2 end to end):
//   session table (dense_session) -> photos (dense_images) -> per-view inference (dense_runner) written to an
//   on-disk pack -> session released -> certified fusion from the pack (dense_fuse_pack) -> PLY.
// Every stage is the gated one; this file only sequences them and owns the disk pack.
//
// [2026-09-15 Stage 3] Progressive delivery. With a chunk callback the job no longer waits for the last view:
// after each inferred view every reference frame whose ref view and all nsrc source views are now inferred is
// fused (FuseScheduler + fuse_pack_frame) and its points are handed to the caller immediately, while
// inference is still running. The fused points are spilled to work_dir/fused_<f>.bin and the PLY is assembled
// in frame order at the end, so out_ply and FusePackStats are byte-for-byte what the chunk-less path writes
// (gated on the certified fixture pack by test_progressive.cc). chunk == nullptr takes the pre-Stage-3 path
// unchanged: infer everything, release the ORT session, then fuse_pack() the whole range.
