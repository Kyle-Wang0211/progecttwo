// PwLodSurface.h — iOS shell half of the LOD point-cloud viewer that has to speak Dawn's C
// structs (chained descriptors are safer in C than in Swift). Everything else in the shell is
// Swift (PwLodTexture.swift / PwLodTexturePlugin.swift / PwLodProbe.swift).
//
// Scope: [v3 2026-09-24] production 171 (feat/lod-on-dense-168): compiled into the Runner target
// and imported by the production bridging header (the bench/feat-lod-viewer-only note of 56f3bb9
// no longer applies). ABI v3 header (pwlod_viewer.h 4e867aa3…).
//
// Swift sees the engine through this header: it includes the two frozen C headers
// (vendor/aether_lod/include/, byte-identical to the coordinator's contract; see SHA256SUMS
// there), so the Clang importer lays out pwlod_camera / pwlod_params / pwlod_frame_stats /
// PwLodProbeSample exactly as the engine was compiled against. Same route as the product's
// own C ABI facade vendor/pw_af/pw_af_c.h (imported by Runner-Bridging-Header.h). No
// DynamicLibrary.process() lookups: the calls are linked statically.
//
// Platform types live only here and in ios/Runner/PwLod*.swift (IOSurface, CVPixelBuffer).
// The engine ABI (pwlod_viewer.h) has none — it only ever sees WGPUTexture +
// WGPUSharedTextureMemory.
