// Test-only instrumentation of the pwlod_viewer render loop (not part of the
// frozen C ABI in pwlod_viewer.h; a shell never calls it).
//
// The plan 3b / B1 judges need to see two things the ABI does not expose:
//   * whether the render thread ever picked a ring target that was the one the
//     consumer holds (or the latest published one) -- counted at the moment the
//     target is chosen, under the same lock acquire_latest takes;
//   * a switch that removes the "not the consumer's target" rule, so the first
//     count can be shown to fire (negative control);
//   * a switch that fills the v2 lowest_spacing with a wrong value (the root's,
//     i.e. the largest spacing), so the lowest_spacing judge can be shown to fire.
